# Repo for practicing Test-Driven Development

The scaffold for this repo is Simple TypeScript Starter made by Khalil Stemmler (https://github.com/stemmlerjs).

I am using it to practice test-driven development by implementing algorithms and data structures.

Exercises come from:

- The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena
- Codewars (https://www.codewars.com/users/ChmielewskiKamil)
- Hackerrank
- Leetcode
