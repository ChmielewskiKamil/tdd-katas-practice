# Left rotation

A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. Given an integer, d, rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.

Function Description
rotateLeft has the following parameters:

- int d: the amount to rotate by
- int arr[n]: the array to rotate

The first line contains two space-separated integers that denote n, the number of integers, and d, the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe arr[].

Sample Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:
5 1 2 3 4
